Bugs found
-------------

- the tooltip that pops up to reveal the full uuid as you hover over the 
  truncated uuid, it would be awesome if you could reduce the font a bit so full uuid fits on one line in 
  the tooltip, and then on the second line the vm "alias name " is listed.
  also would be nice sorting of lists wrked in both directions
- Tooltip bug:  http://cl.ly/image/0i032X010U0S: triggered it by scrolling up and down over tool tips for a while in multi directions.
- When VM is deleted, its still on the list.
- When VM is creted, it does not aprear.
